Upon downloading the GitHub repository, please execute the "run.bat" file. This will initiate the download of all required dependencies through the "pip" package installer, ensuring the proper execution of the included Python files. Once executed, the "run.bat" file will automatically open Microsoft Outlook and run the designated Python script simultaneously. Prior to running the file, please ensure that you have correctly specified the path to the relevant folder in the "run.bat" file. Make sure to run the file as administrator too.

To access the extension within Outlook, simply open an email and click on the "Detect Phishing" option located within the menu denoted by three dots at the top of the screen. Alternatively, users may right-click on the extension and select "Pin to Ribbon" to keep it accessible on the top toolbar for convenient access without the need to navigate through the menu.
